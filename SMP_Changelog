(also known as SMP Mod or Multiplayer Commands Mod)
~!~!~!~!~
This mod acts as a server-side plugin, clients connecting to the server do not need to install this to access its functionality!

Version 1.0:

- Added three new player-to-player teleportation commands: /tpa [playername], /tpaccept [playername], and /tpcancel
    > These can be used without op permissions, allowing players to manage their own teleports without needing to call an admin

- Added a new config file, SMPMod.properties, that lets server hosts disable the tpa commands

- Added an "externalities" config that hosts can enable to punish players for using /tpaccept.
    - CAUTION: Teleporting players will have their inventories wiped!

- Added the /deaths command that shows players how many times they have died in a given world

- Added the /smite command that allows admins to bring divine punishment down upon players

- Added the /tpabove [playername] [# of blocks] command that allows admins to teleport above or below players (stealth spectating)
    - Defaults to 20 blocks above target player
