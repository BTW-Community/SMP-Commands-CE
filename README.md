This is an addon programmed for BTW CE 2.1.4 that adds useful multiplayer commands.

As of version 1.0:

- Added three new player-to-player teleportation commands that can be used without op permissions: /tpa [playername], /tpaccept [playername], and /tpcancel

- Added a new config file, SMPMod.properties, that allows server hosts to enable and disable the tpa commands

- Added config for penalties that are applied to players when teleporting with /tpa

- Added a /tpabove [playername] [# of blocks] command that allows admins to teleport above or below players (stealth spectating)
